## BackgroundModelAnomalyDetection
Use the Image.BackgroundModel functionality to detect anomalies. The background model 
is created from images of objects with no defects, and then run on images of objects
with and without defects.  

### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.12.0 is
required.
